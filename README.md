Hands-on exploration of the properties of the neuronal membrane with interactive JavaScript animations.

This is an ongoing project I started after taking [Fundamentals of Neuroscience](https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-1-the-electrical) on edX. My goal is to delve into concepts like the Nernst equation, the GHK equation, and voltage-gated ion channels.

A demo is available here:
